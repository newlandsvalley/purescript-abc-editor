This is intended eventually to be a port of the Elm AbcEditorController project. At the moment all you can do is enter some ABC text (either from a file or by typing), view the rendered score or else view any error messages from the parser.

To Do
-----

* Transposition
* Change octave
* Change tempo
* Player
* CSS styling
